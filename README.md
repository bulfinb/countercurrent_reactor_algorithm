An algorithm for calculating the thermodynmic limits of species exchange in a countercurrent reactor. The algorithm is theoretically described in my publication [Thermodynamic limits of countercurrent reactor systems, with examples in membrane reactors and the ceria redox cycle](https://doi.org/10.1039/C8CP07077F )
